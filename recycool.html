		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Cool Ways to Recycle is a web game designed and developed by 20+ UCSD students who care about educating elementary kids on how to recycle and stay environmentally conscious. The game includes 5 mini games, progress quizzes, and a main menu with 6 levels represented by animals to save by cumulating a high score. This project was originally a quarter-long project, but we worked through the summer and are still debugging and finalizing our game for distribution.</p>

		<h3>RESEARCH + BRAINSTORMING</h3>
		<p>We started our quarter by going to a nearby elementary school to interview students on what they know about recycling and what games they already enjoy. With that insight, we began brainstorming ideas for games, and voted to settle on a fast pace game comprised of multiple minigames that targetted different aspects of recycling.</p>
		<!--<h4>Brainstorming Game Ideas</h4>-->

		<h4>Rapid Prototyping</h4>
		<img src="img/recycool/recycool_22.jpg"id="post"></img>
		<p>We decided on a game structure similar to Dumb Ways to Die, in which there are multiple mini games to complete before moving onto harder levels. Gradually, this idea expanded and included an "ultimate goal" of saving a planet of animals, each hurt or desprate for help due to the poor waste management of human beings</p> 
		<h3>DEVELOPING + ITERATING</h3>
		<p>As a project manager, I managed a team of 3 developers and 3 artists to design and develop the "catch the trash" minigame and "save the ocean" minigame. I also drew and animated the dolphin character on our main menu and animated the win and lose consequence screens for both games.</p>

	<h3>Solution</h3>
	<h4>The Minigames</h4>
	<p>I project managed for two of the six minigames - Save The Animals and Catch the Trash. Save The Animals is geared towards teaching kids the impact of plastic waste to deep sea animals and ocean life. Catch The Trash is about paper waste and deforestation.</p>

	<h4>The Consequence Screens</h4>
	<p>We created consequence screens for each of these minigames in both the win and lose situations to inform kids the effects of their actions on the environment and animals.</p>

		<h3>USER TESTING</h3>
		<p>Throughout our process, we frequently took our games to elementary schools around San Diego for kids to play and gather insights about how they played and what they had trouble with. One of the challenges we figured out was that kids do not read text during games! This was resolved by including mini quizzes between rounds of mini games, forcing them to read and pass the quiz in order to move on. This is also a way to ensure the educational quality of the game.</p>

		<h3>SOLUTION</h3>
		<p>Our game is officially shipped to the public and shared with many elementary schools in the region! View our journey and play the game at <a href="recy.cool">http://www.recy.cool</a>.</P>

		<h3>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h3>
		<p>Our project was showcased during Design Forward at SD Startup Week 2016 and on the <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/node/2986">UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering Newsletter</a>.</p>
