<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
<p>I love the concept of Snapchat. The 24hr stories, the discovery section, partnerships with food channels and magazines like Tastemade and National Geography, interactive filters and chat sections. However, as a user, I've abandoned Snapchat because of it's unintuitive and error prone user interface.  I gained motivation for this personal project after I spent one hour backing up my Snapchat Memories to my camera roll. (This project is not affiliated with Snapchat.)</p>

<h4>PROBLEM</h4>
<p>I waited 15 minutes for my Memories to save to camera roll, only to receive no confirmation that anything saved, and to find that my camera roll was empty. I spent another hour manually saving all my snaps - taking 4 steps each. I had 77 stories to save, so I had to click 308 times to backup my Snapchat. Then, during my redesign process, I realized that deep within the Settings portion of the app, there was an option to save Stories to both Memories and camera roll during the snapping.</p>

<p>I began by mapping the current Snapchat user flow and taking note of their style guide as I wanted to preserve Snapchat's lively personality despite my goal to minimalize their interface. This section covers the main problems I will tackle in my redesign.</p>

<!--<h3>Icons</h3>

<h2>Social Tab and Record Tab</h2>

<div align="center">
<img src="img/snapchat/record.JPG" id="that" class="picright"></img></div>

<p>The social tab layout has 4 layers, "Live and Discover" on the top, "Recent Updates" from friends, Live below Recent Updates, then "All Stories" from friends. "Live" and "Discover" lack a clear difference, and the repetitive hierarchy takes away from a stress free browsing experience.</p>

<p>The success of an instant snap is highly affected by the second small circle that leads to memories section. It is easily pressed on accident and I have personally lost many footages because of the smaller circle.</p>

<p>Another minor change I wanted to make is to keep the night mode moon sign permanently on the interface. Many users prompt the night mode by covering their camera with their fingers, why not just keep it there to raise exposure anytime we want?</p>

<h2>Memories Tab</h2>

<div align="left">
<img src="img/snapchat/mem3.JPG" id="that" class="picleft"></img></div>
<div align="right">
<img src="img/snapchat/mem4.JPG" id="that" class="picright"></img></div>

<p>A long press and force press leads to two different screens with the exact same options. One has a round icon for stories, and one with the rectangular story screen.  After pressing "Export Story," the default iPhone options come up from below, and users are prompted once again to press "Save to Camera Roll" to complete the process, resulting in 3+ steps before you can actually complete the task. There is no confirmation after story or snap is saved. </p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>Lastly, I want to find a way to make the settings tab more visible and useful for the users to customize saving options and other preferences.</p>

<h4>APPROACH</h4>
<p>I decided to re-design Snapchat UI as a summer project, focusing on making the UI more intuitive and usable. I decided to transform it's aesthetic from the youthful and vibrant look to a sleek and minimalistic design while preserving the original style guide and palette.</p>


<h4>SOLUTION</h4>
<div align="right">
<img src="img/snapchat/hori.JPG" id="that" class="picright"></img></div>
<div align="left">
<img src="img/snapchat/multi.JPG" id="that" class="picleft"></img></div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>I first decided between the multi-dimension flow that Snapchat originaly has and the horizontal layout that I created. I picked the horizontal layout because I realized while the multi-dimension allows users to focus on the snapping and Stories, it was discouraging use of the Memories and Settings by hiding it above and below the snapping screen.</p>
