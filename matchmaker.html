		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Matchmaker is a student-industry partnering service provided by the UC San Diego Design Lab. Under the guidance of Design Lab advisors, students geared towards design and human-computer interaction gain real-world experience by undertaking projects presented by industry clients. Students may be tasked with conducting interviews, usability testing, and visioning sessions, along with many other skill-building activities.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
		<p>We started with competitive analysis of different universities throughout the country that offers students real world connections in the design industry. We interviewed schools like Berkeley, Stanford, University of Michigan to gain insights on how to provide this service for undergraduates.</p>
		<h3>Project scoping and iterating</h3>
		<p>Our client was the Design Lab and the university, which made it extremely difficult to scope our project. We ended up spending the entire quarter iterating our original research plan, and had to interview more and more stakeholders along the way, including San Diego startup companies, professors, and design students.</p>

	<h3>solution</h3>
	<p>The solution included a comprehensive value flow, business plan, and potential syllabus for implementing a MatchMaker program.</p>
	<p>The most two important lessons I learned from working at The Design Lab is 1. It's difficult to move forward with a project without feedback and reviews. 2. It's difficult to sketch out detailed and complete prototypes when the scope of the project is ambiguous (Who is interested? What's the budget? Do we have the power to do x and y as students? Can we create a new course?)</p>
	<p>It is so important to <strong>OWN YOUR PROJECTS</strong> if you want to take it somewhere.</p>
