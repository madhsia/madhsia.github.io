<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
<p>Cool Ways to Recycle is a web game designed and developed by 20+ UCSD students who care about educating elementary kids on how to recycle and stay environmentally conscious. The game includes 5 mini games, progress quizzes, and a main menu with 6 levels represented by animals to save by cumulating a high score. This project was originally a quarter-long project, but we worked through the summer and are still debugging and finalizing our game for distribution.</p>

<h4>RESEARCH and BRAINSTORMING</h4>
<p>We started our quarter by going to a nearby elementary school to interview students on what they know about recycling and what games they already enjoy. With that insight, we began brainstorming ideas for games, and voted to settle on a fast pace game comprised of multiple minigames that targetted different aspects of recycling.</p>

<h4>DEVELOPING and ITERATING</h4>
<p>As a project manager, I managed a team of 3 developers and 3 artists to design and develop the "catch the trash" minigame and "save the ocean" minigame. I also drew and animated the dolphin character on our main menu and animated the win and lose consequence screens for both games.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of the game</p>
